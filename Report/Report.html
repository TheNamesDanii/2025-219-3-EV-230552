    <h1>Computer Science Project Report<br>
        <br>
        Section 1: Meeting The Brief<br>
        
        (incomplete)<br>
        <br>
        Section 2: Investigation<br>
        
        In order to start my investigation process, I decided to take a look at what datasets were available to me and how I could manipulate them to display them in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and also informative to the user. One of my biggest interests at the moment is tanks and military vehicles, however I could not find any datasets about them that I could use. Several websites linked in the brief all have great datasets on other topics however none of them suited my interests because they were either incomplete, lacked the relevant data for me to complete my project and satisfy the brief or were irrelevant to issues/topics I’m interested in today, which was a major factor for me when it comes to deciding on a dataset. Therefore, I went down a long trail of space-related datasets and eventually landed on a page from the government of the United States of America, with a dataset about meteorite landings, sightings and data about them. This was my chosen dataset as I thought this was the most suitable one I could find and also I thought that I could shed some light on how unbelievably diverse and interesting something as mundane as an icy, metallic rock falling from deep space can be.
        I believe the target audience for this project is people such as myself who are amazed by space and also by meteorites in general. This includes meteor collectors, both young and old, and meteoriticists, scientists dedicated to studying meteors and comets.<br>

        Section 3: Plan and Design<br>
        
        For my project, I decided to settle on a dataset from the US government regarding the landings of meteorites on Earth. My reasoning for choosing such a dataset lies with my profound interest in space and anything outside of Earth. This includes meteors, and the idea of objects billions of years old landing on our planet fascinates me.
        I decided to approach this using the AGILE method, in which I tackled each particular problem bit by bit until I was happy with it and came back to it if there was an issue at any point.
        In terms of technologies, I would use Thonny to program the Python area of the project and using libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib and Firebase to both clean, analyse and then store the dataset I had found. When it comes to storing the cleaned and analysed data, Firebase and its Realtime Database feature would be used for storing whatever data I clean, analyse and collect.
        Visual Studio Code would be used for programming anything that wasn’t programmed using Python. This included the stylesheet for the website, which is programmed in CSS and the website itself, which is programmed using a combination of HTML and JavaScript.
        For making the video at the end of the project, OBS Studio would be used for the screen capture which is convenient for me as I am already familiar with OBS and how it functions. In terms of editing the video, KDENlive would be used to edit it however I have never heard of this program before, let alone used it. However, I am very familiar with other editing programs such as Wondershare Filmora and DaVinci Resolve, and KDENlive looks similar enough to them so I shouldn’t find much difficulty in using it.<br>
